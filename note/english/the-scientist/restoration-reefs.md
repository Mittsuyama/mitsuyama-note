prior to
: We confirmed that the corals were sexually mature in the weeks **prior to** the predicted spawning window.

don, gear
: As we **donned** our scuba **gear** and jumped in, the sun dipped below the horizon.

preceding
: in preceding years

naked eye
: ... are visible to the naked eye

gamete, imminent
: Once we saw the **gamete** bundles in position for release, we'd know that spwaning was **imminent**.

a colony of, mounding
: our team observed that **a single colony of** this **mounding** coral species ...

frantically
: (adv. furisouly, wildly) We were **frantically** checking all outplants, over and over.

erupt into, bubbled scream, peel off
: We **erupted into** a quick burst of **bubbled screams** before **peeling off** to go check on the other outplants.

given that
: (assumption, presupposition) **Given that** there were only five divers with a short window of opportunity to ...

momentarily
: The colorful spheres hovered **momentarily** before gracefully floating upward to the ocean surface in an ascent that resembled reverse snowfall.

come to the fore
: (come forward, make a figure) Coral restoration **comes to the fore**.

vessel grounding
: in response to large **vessel groundings** on coral reefs in the ...

mitigate
: (v. to alleviate, ease off, comfort, obtund) ... was to stablize the reef structure and **mitigate** localzed biological damage ...

snip off, degradable, masonry nail, substrate
: Within a few months, branches of coral are **snipped off** the colony and transported to the reef, where they are secured by a **degradable** cable to **masonry nail** hammered into the dead reef or hard-bottom **substrate**.

expedite
: (vt. facilirtate, promote; adj. boost, rapid) ... that **expedite** their growth and maturation.

in the nick of time
: (in time) We are now implementing these approaches on the reefs to the Florida Keys -- and just **in the nick of time**.

practitioner, manipulate, degraded, survivorship, demographic
: The methods with which **practitioners** select, rear, propagate, and **manipulate** corals for restoring **degraded** reefs will have consequences for the **survivorship** of outplants and resilience of restored populations. Understanding the genetic and **demographic** properties that ...

## The Phages Within

mammalian, gut
: Bacteria-infecting viruses affect the composition and behavior of microbes in the **mammalian gut** -- and perhaps influence animals' health.

strain (genus), commensal
: ... what causes some **strains** of normally harmless **commensal** bacteria.

take ... for granted
: researchers **take their presence for granted**.

put on hold
: (delay, over-ride) Encouraged by Hooper, he **put his original project on hold** in order to dig depper.

beneficially or detrimentally
: ... that can influence the outcome on the host -- either **beneficially or detrimentally**.

crop up
: (pop up, break out in, burst in on) When it crops up, it's not good news.

gummy, mucoid
: (evil, viscous) Cells with the **gummy mucoid** coating, the researchers noted, were more resistant to phage infection than regular cells were.

be followed by, rebound, follow suit
: Low bacterial densities at birth **were followed by** decreases in phages, after which the bacteria would **rebound**, and then the phages would **follow suit**.

lyse, lysogeny
: ... made virus particles **lyse** the bacterium and go on to infect more cells. In the second process, known as **lysogeny**, ...

elsewhere, overtaken, soaring population
: in Germany, and **elsewhere** before being **overtaken** worldwide by the **soaring population** of antibiotics in the 1940s.
